Snowflake supports three types of views.
    Standard View
    Secure View
    Materialized View

Four Types of Tables
    External
    Transient
    Temp
    Permanent


Snowflake connects external apps
    Spark
    Kafka
    Python

In the WebUI
    Node
    Spark
    Go
    JDBC


3 to 4 Columns Preferred for a Cluster Key


Shared Data
    it's read only, you can't time-travel, cloning, or editing



Security Admin
    Warehouses
    History
    Account


use warehouse

To Administer Shares you need Import Shares Privilege


Snowflake is for OLAP Online Analytical Processing

Create table is by CloudServices and doesn't need a warehouse







Everything is encyped at rest and in motion


Older history is in account usage



Release types
    Full Release
    Patch Release (weekly)
    behiovr change



UDFs
    Java, Javascript, Python, SQL


SPROC
    Java, Javascript, Scala, Java Snowflake
    sprocs aren't python or sql

Which is not the Security function of cloud services layer?

Not Metadata Management Cloud Services layer
Micro Partiion

More Info:
Metadata Management has following major functions:
    - Stores metadata as data is loaded into the system
    - Handles queries that can be processes completely from metadata
    -Used for Time Travel and Cloning
    -Every aspect of Snowflake architecture leverages metadata



Optimization Activites of Cloud Services
    Cost based
    Automatic Join Order
    Stats Gathering
    Pruing using metadata

Which actions are not supported with shared data?
    all
    Share is just for read, not for cloning or time-travel query or any edit.


Which of the following are unique objects introduced by Snowflake?
    STAGE and PIPE are unique Snowflake objects.






Snowflake offers the early access of staged release to designated Standard Edition Customer. True or false?
    Snowflake offers early access to designated Enterprise (or higher) accounts.

    Early access is not required or recommended for all organizations with Enterprise Edition accounts; Snowflakeâ€™s rigorous release testing and monitoring during deployments is usually sufficient to prevent most issues. Early access is intended primarily for organizations that desire added certainty that their production accounts will not be affected by full releases.





You have an Employee Table. You ran a query SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE;. Then you deleted a record from EMPLOYEE table.
You again ran query SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE.
    storage layer



Can you have a database overlap across two Snowflake account?
    No



Each Snowflake account comes with two shared databases. One is a set of sample data and the other contains Account Usage information. Check all true statements about these shared databases.
