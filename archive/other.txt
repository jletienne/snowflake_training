A VARIANT can hold a value of any other data type, including an ARRAY or an OBJECT. An ARRAY or OBJECT holds a value of type VARIANT.

Snowflake can import semi-structured data from JSON, Avro, ORC, Parquet, and XML formats and store it in Snowflake data types designed specifically to support semi-structured data.


select object_column['thirteen'],
       object_column:thirteen
    from object_example;


The LOGIN_HISTORY family of table functions can be used to query login attempts by Snowflake users along various dimensions:
LOGIN_HISTORY returns login events within a specified time range.
LOGIN_HISTORY_BY_USER returns login events of a specified user within a specified time range.


This Account Usage view can be used to query the access history of Snowflake objects (e.g. table, view, column) within the last 365 days (1 year).

A Directory table is not a separate database object; it stores a catalog of staged files in cloud storage. Roles with sufficient privileges can query a directory table to retrieve file URLs to access the staged files and other metadata.

DROP STAGE [ IF EXISTS ] <name>

By default, COPY INTO location statements separate table data into a set of output files to take advantage of parallel operations. The maximum size for each file is set using the MAX_FILE_SIZE copy option. The default value is 16777216 (16 MB) but can be increased to accommodate larger files. The maximum file size supported is 5 GB for Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure stages.




Semi-structured data is typically stored in the following Snowflake data types:

ARRAY: similar to an array in other languages.

OBJECT: similar to a JSON object, also called a “dictionary”, “hash”, or “map” in many languages. This contains key-value pairs.

VARIANT: a data type that can hold a value of any other data type (including ARRAY and OBJECT). VARIANT is used to build and store hierarchical data.

Snowflake provides native data types (ARRAY, OBJECT, and VARIANT) for storing semi-structured data.



OBJECT_CONSTRUCT
Returns an OBJECT constructed from the arguments.


Specify the input data format and the Snowflake data type by calling an appropriate function to convert the data. For example, to convert JSON-formatted data to a VARIANT value, call PARSE_JSON, as shown below:



SELECT * FROM DIRECTORY( @<stage_name> )


TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS



If the data is imported in JSON, Avro, ORC, or Parquet format, then Snowflake can build the hierarchy for you and store it in a VARIANT. You can also create a hierarchy manually.
